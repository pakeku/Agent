OSAgent
=======

**OSAgent** is a cross-platform agent designed for secure remote management and monitoring of endpoints (computers). My goal is to support Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a versatile solution for system administrators and IT professionals.

Overview
--------

OSAgent will allow administrators to remotely control, monitor, and manage endpoints through a centralized interface. It will be designed to operate seamlessly across multiple operating systems, offering a unified experience for remote management tasks.

Desired Features
----------------

I will be working on developing the following features:

-   **Secure Remote Control**: Access and manage endpoints securely from any location.
-   **Remote Installations**: Deploy and install software or updates remotely.
-   **Health Monitoring**: Collect and display system health metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and more.
-   **Error Reporting**: Log and report system errors or issues for proactive management.
-   **File Browsing**: Navigate and manage the file system on remote endpoints.
-   **OS Patching**: Apply OS updates and patches remotely.
-   **More?**: We welcome suggestions and contributions for additional features.
